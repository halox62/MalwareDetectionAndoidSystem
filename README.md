# MalwareDetectionAndoidSystem

## Project Description
This project is a thesis work by Giorgio Martucci, focused on the development of a Flask-based web application for Android malware classification. The project was supervised by Prof. Cantini Riccardo at the University of Calabria. The application uses Deep Learning machine learning models to classify Android device logs and analyze the decisions taken by the system with explainable ai mechanisms.

## Features
- Automatic classification: Automatically classify Android application logs as Malware or NOT Malware
- Detailed reports: Generate detailed classification reports
- Explainable ai: Use explainable ai techniques to explain the decisions made by the model

## Technologies Used
Python 3.10.0
TensorFlow for machine learning
Lime for explainable ai
Flusk for web application
